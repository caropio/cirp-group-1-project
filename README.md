# SAFE ‚Äì Shared Awareness For Emergencies üåçüö®

This project was created as part of the CIRP Program Week group project by Haruka KOBAYASHI, Maria Angelica MEZA RIOS, Riu Gabriel RODRIGUEZ, Rui MAO, Caroline PIOGER, Chlo√© Anna H√ñLLERER. We had only 72 hours to imagine and prototype an innovative pedagogical product.

Our product is the SAFE app (Shared Awareness For Emergencies), whose visuals are presented on the ```learn.html```, ```prepare.html```, ```respond.html``` and ```recover.html``` pages. 

This is an imaginary project ‚Äî the app does not exist as a real product.
We used this code as a way to present the idea in a web-based format.

This project is a static multi-page website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
As it is, it will run locally (via python -m http.server), don't forget to adapt the cd in the ```run.sh``` file !

Due to time constraints, some commit messages are not descriptive (e.g. just "update").
‚ö†Ô∏è This is not good practice in real coding projects! 
In a real-world project, commits should clearly explain the changes made.

Still, we hope this project can serve as an inspiration for students and beginners to discover that:
Building a simple, functional website in short time is doable and fun
